VideoSettingsTitle:Video Settings

VideoSettingsPrefRes:Preferred resolution:

VideoSettingsPrefResDesc:Set the resolution you'd typically like the game to be, it'll start up this way and change once you accept on this screen. You can still resize the window though, unless you turn that off.

VideoSettingsNoResize:Disallow resizing:

VideoSettingsNoResizeDesc:Prevent the window from changing shape from your preferred resolution. You can't maximise the window if you do this either though, so make sure your preferred res really is preferred!

VideoSettingsPrefResMin:Preferred res is minimum:

VideoSettingsPrefResMinDesc:If you still have window resizing enabled, this option will stop you from shrinking the window beyond your preferred resolution. If you do, it'll snap back to the res you set.

VideoSettingsAeroOffsets:Use aero offset fix:

VideoSettingsAeroOffsetsDesc:If you are noticing the window being slightly smaller than it should be, and/or mouse detection is off a bit, this option should sort it out. Don't enable this if you aren't having any problems.

VideoSettingsRestrictColours:Restrict text colours:

VideoSettingsEnableColoursDesc:Colours in text add a few more instruction things to the render cycle process. You can restrict the maximum amount of colours a single string can have which may resolve lag or concentration issues.
